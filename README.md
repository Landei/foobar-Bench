foobar-Bench
============

a little, very inaccurate benchmark tool (using Java)

------------

How to use (Java):

1. Download an open the "JavaEditor"
2. Create a new console project
3. Name the project "foobar_bench"
4. Copy&paste the code in to the project
5. Click on run!

(I try to make this with the cmd under Windows!)
